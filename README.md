- 👋 Hi, I’m @Reidjoss
- 👀 I’m interested in learning some basic programming so I could create tools that I need myself.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic HTML/CSS and some PHP.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that aim to help people with the same mission as myself.
- 📫 Contact me at Discord @ Reedtrullz#9620
